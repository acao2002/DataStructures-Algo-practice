# Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA)

Data Structures are tools that we use to manage and organize data. Algorithms are specific steps that we take to arrive at a particular solution. DSAs are important concepts for programming and are often used in complex applications and tested in techinical interviews for software engineering positions. 

DSAs can be hard to navigate being a self-learner or new in coding in general. As someone who is going the process of self-studying DSAs, I decide to put together this github repository, where I corroborate my own understanding and different sources(that I used) to write up short introductions and tutorials for these concepts. 

In addition to explaning the theory, I have also included my solutions of [Hackerrank DSA problems](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures), which are sorted into each category(linkedlist, trees, dynamic programming, etc..). Hackerrank problems are great for beginners to follow each concept and learn its operations. They also rank you among Hackerrank coders, which somewhat gives you the motivation to grind I guess :). 

Below is an index of this repository, which, I hope, would help you navigate through my collections and somewhat help you with your DSA grinding journey! 

# Data Structures


1. Linked List 

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers

2. Tree

A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.
