# Merge Sort

Merge Sort divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.

## Algorithm

MergeSort(arr[], l,  r)
If r > l
     1. Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves:  
             middle m = l+ (r-l)/2
     2. Call mergeSort for first half:   
             Call mergeSort(arr, l, m)
     3. Call mergeSort for second half:
             Call mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)
     4. Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:
             Call merge(arr, l, m, r)

## Implementation(Python)

```python

  
def quickSort(arr, low, high): 
    if len(arr) == 1: 
        return arr 
    if low < high: 
  
        # pi is partitioning index, arr[p] is now 
        # at right place 
        pi = partition(arr, low, high) 
  
        # Separately sort elements before 
        # partition and after partition 
        quickSort(arr, low, pi-1) 
        quickSort(arr, pi+1, high) 
# Python program for implementation of MergeSort
def mergeSort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
 
         # Finding the mid of the array
        mid = len(arr)//2
 
        # Dividing the array elements
        L = arr[:mid]
 
        # into 2 halves
        R = arr[mid:]
 
        # Sorting the first half
        mergeSort(L)
 
        # Sorting the second half
        mergeSort(R)
 
        i = j = k = 0
 
        # Copy data to temp arrays L[] and R[]
        while i < len(L) and j < len(R):
            if L[i] < R[j]:
                arr[k] = L[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = R[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
 
        # Checking if any element was left
        while i < len(L):
            arr[k] = L[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
 
        while j < len(R):
            arr[k] = R[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
```

## Analysis

Pros:

Merge Sort is useful for sorting linked lists in O(nLogn) time.In the case of linked lists, the case is different mainly due to the difference in memory allocation of arrays and linked lists. Unlike arrays, linked list nodes may not be adjacent in memory. Unlike an array, in the linked list, we can insert items in the middle in O(1) extra space and O(1) time. Therefore, the merge operation of merge sort can be implemented without extra space for linked lists.

In arrays, we can do random access as elements are contiguous in memory. Let us say we have an integer (4-byte) array A and let the address of A[0] be x then to access A[i], we can directly access the memory at (x + i*4). Unlike arrays, we can not do random access in the linked list. Quick Sort requires a lot of this kind of access. In a linked list to access i’th index, we have to travel each and every node from the head to i’th node as we don’t have a continuous block of memory. Therefore, the overhead increases for quicksort. Merge sort accesses data sequentially and the need of random access is low.

Cons:

Slower comparative to the other sort algorithms for smaller tasks.

Merge sort algorithm requires additional memory space of 0(n) for the temporary array .

It goes through the whole process even if the  array is sorted.
