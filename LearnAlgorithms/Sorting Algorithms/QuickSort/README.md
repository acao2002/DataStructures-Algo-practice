# Quick Sort

Quick sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts an array by repeating the process of partitioning itself surrounding a pivot item

## Algorithm

The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as pivot, put x at its correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.

## Implementation(Python)

```python

#Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-for-quicksort/

# Python program for implementation of Quicksort Sort 
  
# This function takes last element as pivot, places 
# the pivot element at its correct position in sorted 
# array, and places all smaller (smaller than pivot) 
# to left of pivot and all greater elements to right 
# of pivot 
  
  
def partition(arr, low, high): 
    i = (low-1)         # index of smaller element 
    pivot = arr[high]     # pivot 
  
    for j in range(low, high): 
  
        # If current element is smaller than or 
        # equal to pivot 
        if arr[j] <= pivot: 
  
            # increment index of smaller element 
            i = i+1
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i] 
  
    arr[i+1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i+1] 
    return (i+1) 
  
# The main function that implements QuickSort 
# arr[] --> Array to be sorted, 
# low  --> Starting index, 
# high  --> Ending index 
  
# Function to do Quick sort 
  
  
def quickSort(arr, low, high): 
    if len(arr) == 1: 
        return arr 
    if low < high: 
  
        # pi is partitioning index, arr[p] is now 
        # at right place 
        pi = partition(arr, low, high) 
  
        # Separately sort elements before 
        # partition and after partition 
        quickSort(arr, low, pi-1) 
        quickSort(arr, pi+1, high) 

```

## Analysis

Time Complexity: O(NlogN) for simple cases and O(N^2) for complicated cases 

QuickSort requires no extra spaces
