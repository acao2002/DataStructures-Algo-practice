# Binary Tree

A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.

A Binary Tree node contains following parts.

__1. Data__

__2. Pointer to left child__

__3. Pointer to right child__

# Why tree?

1. One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a computer: 
```
file system
-----------
     /    <-- root
  /      \
...       home
      /          \
   ugrad        course
    /       /      |     \
  ...      cs101  cs112  cs113
```
2. Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays). 
3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists). 
4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees donâ€™t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.
Main applications of trees include: 
1. Manipulate hierarchical data. 
2. Make information easy to search (see tree traversal). 
3. Manipulate sorted lists of data. 
4. As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects. 
5. Router algorithms 
6. Form of a multi-stage decision-making (see business chess). 

## Basic Tree implementation python

```python

# Python program to introduce Binary Tree
 
# A class that represents an individual node in a
# Binary Tree
class Node:
    def __init__(self,key):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.val = key
 
 
# create root
root = Node(1)
''' following is the tree after above statement
        1
      /   \
     None  None'''
 
root.left      = Node(2);
root.right     = Node(3);
   
''' 2 and 3 become left and right children of 1
           1
         /   \
        2      3
     /    \    /  \
   None None None None'''
 
 
root.left.left  = Node(4);
'''4 becomes left child of 2
           1
       /       \
      2          3
    /   \       /  \
   4    None  None  None
  /  \
None None'''
